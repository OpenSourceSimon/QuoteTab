# "Quote tab"
Changes your new tab page to a minimalistic page. Just a simple clock, random nature background and random quote. And the best part, it is completely open source.

## Requirements

- For so far only tested on Chrome and Edge. Firefox manifest is not yet added. If you want to use it on Firefox, please use an extension that allows you to change the new tab page to a custom URL. (I recommend [this one](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/))

## Installation üë©‚Äçüíª

1. Clone this repository
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable Developer Mode and click Load unpacked extension button and upload the folder
4. Enjoy!

## Quote
This extension uses [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable) to get random quotes. It is a free API that is open source!  

## Contributing & Ways to improve üìà

In its current state, this extension does exactly what it needs to do. However, improvements can always be made!

I have tried to simplify the code so anyone can read it and start contributing at any skill level. Don't be shy :) contribute!
